# DelphiDocumentTree
This repository is dedicated to a powerful system that efficiently organizes the contents of a text file into a beautiful and intuitive hierarchical tree structure. The system provides seamless import and export functionalities, making it easy to work with tree data.

## Features
- **Import:** The system can import a text file and intelligently parse its contents to create a hierarchical tree structure. Each line of the file represents a node in the tree, and the relationships between nodes are determined by indentation or delimiters.
- **Export:** The system allows users to export the organized tree structure back into a text file, preserving the original format and indentation. This ensures that the exported file retains the same hierarchical structure as the imported one.
- **Efficient Algorithm:** The system employs an efficient parsing algorithm that swiftly handles large text files, making the import process quick and seamless.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system boasts an intuitive user interface that simplifies the import and export processes. Users can easily navigate and interact with the tree structure, enhancing their productivity and experience.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import a text file by running the designated import function and specifying the file path.
3. Explore and manipulate the hierarchical tree structure using the user-friendly interface.
4. Export the modified tree structure to a text file by running the export function.
5. Enjoy the organized and visually appealing tree structure!
